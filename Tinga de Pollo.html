            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3-4 medium size chicken breast</li>
                <li>4-5 tablespoons of oil</li>
                <li>1-2 large onions sliced</li>
                <li>4-5 medium Roma(plum)tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 can of Chipotle chiles in Adobo</li>
                <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pot of salty water to a boil and add the chicken breast to cook. Let the chicken simmer until it is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Make sure you skim the foam that forms on top of the water as it starts boiling.</li>
                <li>While the chicken is cooking, place the tomatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with water, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and mushy but not falling apart.</li>
                <li>Slice the onions thinly. Heat the oil in a large pan(skillet) and add the onion. Cook the onion until soft and translucent for about 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a blender, throw the tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper, and 2-3 chipotle chiles from the can. Be careful with the chiles. The original Mexican recipe calls for the entire can of Chipotle, but I found it to be too powerful and spicy for us, so I added fewer chiles in the blender.</li>
                <li>After blending the ingredients, taste the salsa for salt and pepper and adjust the amount of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Pour the salsa over onions. Add oregano, marjoram, thyme, and pepper. (Be careful as the sauce will steam and bubble).</li>
                <li>Simmer the sauce, occasionally stirring, until the sauce deepens in color, becomes darker and less soupy, about 7-8 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
